## Welcome to the Department of GitHub Efficiency

We're a semi-serious, overly-efficient, fully-automated department dedicated to raising the bar for collaboration, CI/CD and DevOps practices. Expect bots with badges, lint with opinions and pipelines that won't let you ship broken code on a Friday.

Whether you're a lone engineer or part of a sprawling dev bureaucracy, we're here to help you do things the right way - or at least get loudly warned when you don't.

### Mandates include:
- Clean commits
- Smart merges
- Healthy pipelines
- Passive-aggressive GitHub Actions

Join us in our mission to make bad practices extinct (or at least deeply annoying).
